## USAGE

```yaml
jobs:
  flutter-analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write # required to add comment on PR
    steps:
      # checkout your repository and install flutter

      # run flutter analyze with --write option
      - name: Run flutter analyze
        run: flutter analyze --write=flutter_analyze.log

      # use flutter-analyze-commenter
      - name: Comment PR by flutter-analyze-commenter
        uses: yorifuji/flutter-analyze-commenter@v1
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}            # run this step even if flutter analyze fails
        with:
          analyze_log: flutter_analyze.log # file path of flutter analyze log
          verbose: true 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　# optional: default is false
```

## How it works

The flutter-analyze-commenter reads the log file generated by flutter analyze and posts comments on the pull request with any issues found.
If an issue is already commented and unchanged, it will not post a duplicate comment. Comments from previous runs that no longer apply to the current code will be deleted.
